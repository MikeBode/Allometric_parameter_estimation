The file labelled "Pike_IsometricEffort_vs_Hyperallometric_effort.m" is a set of matlab functions that calculate the fishing effort at MSY (and the associated maximum sustainable yield) for comparable populations with hyperallometric and isometric reproduction. 

The TIFF image "MSY_comparison.tiff" plots the results of the pike analysis.
